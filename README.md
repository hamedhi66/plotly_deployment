# plotly_deployment

The purpose of this project is to visualize the bacterial species in belly bottoms from volunteers. 

To do so, a drop down option is created to select the volunteer IDs. A bar chart is created to identify the top 10  bacterial species (OTUs) for each volunteer. Demographic information is shown for the same volunteer. Additionally, to better represent the data a bubble chart is created.
